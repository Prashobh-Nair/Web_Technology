        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>GreenLeaf Nursery was founded in 2010 by Priya Patel, a passionate horticulturist with a vision to bring the beauty and benefits of plants to everyone. What started as a small local nursery has grown into a leading provider of high-quality plants and gardening services across India.</p>
        <p>Priya's love for plants began in her childhood, where she spent countless hours in her grandmother's garden, learning about different plant species and their unique needs.  This early experience inspired her to pursue a degree in horticulture and eventually start her own nursery.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, GreenLeaf Nursery has been committed to providing exceptional customer service and fostering a love for plants in the community. We believe that plants have the power to transform spaces, improve well-being, and connect people with nature.</p>
